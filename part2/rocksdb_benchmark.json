This usually works, but if the level doesn't have any overlapping file, it will be more efficient to go further down. This is because the files are likely to be trivial moved further and might create a violation of max_compaction_bytes.

Compactions are out of the picture - automatic compactions are disabled, and for manual compactions we don't care that much if they fall behind. We write to many CFs, with only a few L0 sst files in each, so compactions are not needed most of the time.\n(2) total_log_size_ is consistently greater than GetMaxTotalWalSize(). It doesn't get smaller since flushes are falling ever further behind.\n(3) Total size of memtables is way above db_write_buffer_size and keeps growing. But the write_buffer_manager_->ShouldFlush() is not checked because (2) prevents it (for no good reason, afaict; this is what this commit fixes).\n(4) Every call to WriteImpl() hits the MaybeFlushColumnFamilies() path. This keeps flushing the memtables one by one in order of increasing log file number.\n(5) No write stalling trigger is hit. We rely on max_write_buffer_number\nCloses https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1893\n\nDifferential Revision: D4593590\n\nPulled By: yiwu-arbug\n\nfbshipit-source-id: af79c5f",
